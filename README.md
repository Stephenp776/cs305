Artemis Financial, a client in the highly regulated financial sector, required enhanced software security to protect sensitive data due to potential threats like phishing, ransomware, and DDOS attacks. They needed secure communication, data confidentiality, and adherence to standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

The assessment identified vulnerabilities, including insufficient input validation, unsecured API endpoints, weak password storage, lack of data encryption, insecure authentication mechanisms, hardcoded credentials, and inadequate logging. To address these, improvements included enhanced input validation, secured APIs, stronger password hashing, consistent data encryption, multi-factor authentication, secure credential storage, and robust logging practices.

Coding securely is crucial to prevent breaches that could lead to financial losses or reputational damage. Security adds value by safeguarding the company's assets and ensuring compliance. While identifying vulnerabilities, manual inspection was particularly helpful, although static testing highlighted dependencies requiring updates. Ensuring code security involved continuous testing and monitoring, and after refactoring, I used tools like dependency-check reports to verify the absence of new vulnerabilities.

Future tools and practices, such as automated scanning tools, dependency checks, and secure coding standards, are vital for consistent assessments and mitigation. These strategies and my secure coding practices are valuable takeaways for demonstrating proficiency to future employers.
